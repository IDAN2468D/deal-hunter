# Active Context: Lumina Lab Redesign

## Current Status
The Lumina Lab (AI Toolkit) consists of a main hub page and several tools:
- **Value Map (MAP):** Live. Uses a 3D Globe to show deals.
- **Smart Budget (BUDGET):** Live. Predicts budget allocation.
- **Squad Mode (SQUAD):** Placeholder.
- **Visual Scan (VISUAL):** Placeholder.
- **Price Alerts (ALERTS):** Placeholder.
- **Review Intel (REVIEWS):** Placeholder.

## Objective
Redesign all features to align with the "Obsidian Lumina" design system (Premium Tactical). This includes:
1.  **Immersive Hub:** A more sophisticated sidebar and main panel layout.
2.  **Advanced Map:** Enhancing the Globe with better HUD elements and smoother transitions.
3.  **Dynamic Budget:** Implementing realistic financial charts (framer-motion) and interactive sliders.
4.  **Squad Mode (Teaser):** A futuristic interface for multi-agent collaboration.
5.  **Visual Scan (Teaser):** A neural-looking interface for analyzing travel images.

## Technology Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Framer Motion
- Lucide Icons
- Canvas/Three.js (for the Globe)
